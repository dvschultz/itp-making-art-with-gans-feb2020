• [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/) (A paid plan is not required, but may be helpful)
• [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Colab Pro is a very good deal, but not required) or a Linux machine capable of running Jupyter notebooks and running NVIDIA GPU. Colab requires a Google account.
